# Tree app thing

[Code heavily pulls from this starting point][https://github.com/AlbertoFormaggio1/Where-Am-I]

TO DO

* colour code species?
* remove any duplicates
* if user clicks on map, do nearest trees calculation from that point - add reset button
* update timing of reset and map items (eg pins) - if computing at a new point turn off updates until reset
* change to N trees
* add all trees in the background? - hmm kinda dont like this now
* fix crash caused when less than 5 trees avaliable for a selection (try catch)
* tidy code
